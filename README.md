a more modernized moomoo.io clone
additional features are from TODO.md, taken directly from sidney's moomoo2 todo list or are just some ideas i want to do.

disclaimer: do not trust anyone else hosting this project, moomoo.io community is not exactly safe.

inspiration for this project:
there hasn't been any proper clone of moomoo.io publicly released since lightbulb's sanctuary project (excluding mohmoh, very god).
that too is using outdated tech, and doesnt really build off the main game.
with this project im hoping to modernize moomoo.io and actually implement some features the original devs intended to add (except a few, like clan roles)
however its almost impossible to understand sidney, hes a buffoon. all implementations are based on my interpretation of his list (and potentially how mohmoh implemented some mechanics)

oh yeah, i'll be taking inspiration of snapshots of foes.io, as that is what sidney and vincent intended on moomoo.io becoming.

also, plan on using corvoda to make this accessible to mobile.
